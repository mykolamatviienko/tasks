        //      You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.
        //      As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

        //      For example, if n = 10:

        //      return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
